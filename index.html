            <p>We live in an Age of Unsafety.</p>

            <p>This age began in <em>1972</em>, with the <em>C</em>
            language, and with <em>Unix</em>, and today it encompasses
            all that we see. Unsafety is at the foundation of the
            computing world.</p>

            <p>And now we are beset on all sides. The barbarians are
            at the gate.</p>

            <p>The internet is no longer safe, and the tools of the
            past are no longer up to the task of securing it.</p>

            <p>That is why Rust exists.</p>

            <p>My name is Brian Anderson, and this is my friend Alex
            Crichton, and we are both members of the Rust programming
            languages core team, as well as being employed to work on
            Rust by Mozilla Research.</p>

            <p>Alex will you introduce yourself?</p>

            <p>Alex: I've been working on Rust since 2013, where I
              have been responsible for large portions of the standard
              library and the broader library ecosystem. I'm also
              etc.</p>

            <p>Brian: I've been working on Rust since 2010, involved
            in every aspect of its development. Much of my work has
            been in the standard library, tooling, platform support,
            community building. I have a special passion for software
            validation and ensuring that Rust is rock solid from
            release to release.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Rust is first and foremost
            a <em>high-performance</em>, <em>memory safe</em>, systems
            programming language. And when I say "high-performance", I
            don't just mean it's fast, I mean it's competitive with
            the very fastest programming languages. <em>Think C, C++,
            and Fortran</em>.</p>

            <p>And when I say "memory safe" I mean that Rust software
            does not crash, at least not in the way that languages
            like C and C++ do, where a crash can lead to
            unpredictable, and - most importantly - exploitable
            behavior.</p>

            <p><em>Rust provides the very best performance without
            sacrificing safety</em>.</p>

            <p>It accomplishes this by being designed completely
            around safe, <em>zero-cost abstractions</em>. The code you
            write corresponds quite directly to the code the machine
            runs. Accordingly, Rust has <em>no runtime</em>, and -
            crucially - <em>no garbage collector</em>. And this makes
            Rust extremely <em>portable</em> - Rust will run on just
            about anything with a CPU, everything from
            <em>microcontrollers</em> to <em>supercomputers</em>.</p>

            <p>Rust is a thriving, collaboratively developed <em>open
            source</em> project sponsored by <em>Mozilla</em>, the
            makers of <em>Firefox</em>, who employ Alex and myself.</p>

          Disclaimers

          <aside class="notes">
            A quick disclaimer. In the Rust project we take
            great <em>pride</em> in being
            <em>civil</em>, in not putting down the competition. But
            Rust is a <em>direct competitor</em> to C and C++ in the
            marketplace, and this talk will say much about the
            <em>weaknesses of C and C++</em> in comparison to Rust. As
            former C and C++ programmers ourselves we have the
            greatest <em>respect</em> for their users and
            creators. We'll try to stick to the <em>facts</em>, and we
            beg your forgiveness if we misspeak. Toward the end of
            this talk we'll discuss some of <em>Rust's own
            weaknesses</em>.

            <p>Now, the Rust of 2009 was much different from the Rust
            of today. But even then, the <em>primary objective was to
            solve the memory safety problem</em>, but the assumptions were
            different.</p>

            <p>Back then, even the Rust team thought the <em>only
            viable way to solve the memory safety problem was through
            a garbage collector</em>, so Rust's heaps were garbage
            collected, but that garbage collection
            was <em>thread-local</em>.  That way garbage collection in
            one thread would not <em>interfere with progress</em> in
            other threads. This was in <em>important early
            constraint</em>, and it influenced our ultimate
            solution.</p>

            <p>Rust was, at the time, a <em>green-threaded</em>
            programming language in the style of Go, with ML
            influences.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>But these assumptions did not hold.</p>

          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And the reason that both these original assumptions
            didn't hold boils down to <em>performance</em> - for our
            use cases we can <em>tolerate no runtime abstraction
            costs</em>, and both garbage collection, even if it is
            single-threaded, and green-threading, impose significant
            overhead.</p>

            <p>But it took us a <em>long time</em> to come to
            this <em>conclusion</em>, and we only came to it
            <em>indirectly</em>. For a long time we thought these
            costs would be acceptable - it was only after reaching an
            important <em>insight</em> about the design of Rust that
            we realized not only the <em>importance</em>

            <p>Let me illustrate the problem. Here we have <em>two

            <p>So far so good. But how should the language actually
            implement that? Well, since the Rust of 2009 had isolated
            heaps, perhaps we make a <em>deep copy</em> of the
            balloon, copying the balloon over to the other heap.</p>

            But what if the balloon itself contains <em>pointers to
            other ballons</em>? And what if one of those contains a
            <em>pointer back into the stack</em>? How do you deal with
            those?

            <p>These are hard problems to solve, and it's easy to end up back in a

          The Rust insight
          <p class="fragment">Rust is Cyclone + Singularity</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For months we batted around this <em>problem</em>
            of <em>sending objects</em> between threads
            without <em>invalidating pointers</em>, and without a
            <em>garbage collector</em>.</p>

            <p>Around this time <em>Niko Matsakis</em> joined the
            team. Niko was an actual trained <em>type theorist</em>,
            and he brought some good ideas.</p>

            <p>Niko was looking at a research project called <em>Cyclone</em>
            and wondering if we could learn from it. Cyclone was a
            safe dialect of C that used <em>static analysis</em> to track the
            validity of pointers.</p>

            <p>Cyclone's system was somewhat limited and did not directly solve
            our multithreading problem.</p>

            <p>But also at the same time we became aware of another
            research project at Microsoft
            called <em>Singularity</em>. It was an attempt to
            reimagine the operating system in .NET. There wasn't a lot
            of information coming out of Microsoft but what caught our
            eye was their <em>approach to concurrency</em>. In
            Singularity they employed a novel technique
            to <em>transfer ownership</em> of - and <em>sole
            access</em> to - <em>entire regions of memory</em> between threads,
            by only <em>copying a pointer</em>.</p>

            <p>(next fragment)</p>

            <p>In a real sense Rust is Cyclone plus Singularity.</p>

            <p>And the result in Rust is what we call "<em>ownership and borrowing</em>".</p>

        <section id="OWN">
          <h3>Ownership and borrowing</h3>
          <p>In Rust, every value has a single, statically-known,
            owning path in the code, at any time.</p>
          <p>Pointers to values have limited duration, known as a
            "lifetime", that is also statically tracked.</p>
          <p>All pointers to all values are known statically.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is kind of the key takeaway of this whole presentation. Ownership
            and borrowing is what makes Rust, Rust.</p>

            <p>Now there are actually are caveats and exceptions, but
            if you understand this, you understand how Rust approaches
            the memory safety problem.</p>

            <p>One of the neat things about ownership and borrowing as

            <p>Here's a summary of ownership and borrowing.</p>

            <p>This is how Rust thinks about all resources. A
            convenient way to think of this system is that Rust shared
            and mutable references provide <em>reader-writer
            locks</em> over owned values. Rust provides in access
            control to all memory, and that access control is
            completely determined statically, with no runtime
            overhead.</P>

            <p>This system provides fine, deterministic, static, and
              foolproof control over resources. And this control enables
              Rust's powerful <em>zero-cost abstractions</em>, and it's
              <em>incredible performance</em>.</p>

            picture of Rust. But that's not to say that Rust is
            perfect. We've got a long way to go yet.</p>

            <p>In this portion we'll talk first about some
            the <em>challenges</em> Rust faces, and some if its
            <em>deficiencies</em>. Then we'll say a bit about the
            future direction of Rust, and the future of unsafety.</p>

          <h3>Rust soft challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Acceptance / learning curve</li>
            <li>Competition from other languages</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So we think Rust is in a <em>very strong position</em>
            right now. It has <em>qualities</em> that no other
            language stack has, and that are not easy to achieve. But
            Rust's long-term success is <em>not yet guaranteed</em>,
            and it's adoption, while growing quickly, is still
            modest.</p>

            <p>A big challenge is Rust's <em>learning
            curve</em>. While Rust has a reasonably <em>familiar
            syntax</em> to C++ programmers, it's semantics are just as
            much derived from <em>ML and Haskell</em>. We believe
            Rust's semantics are quite attractive for systems
            programmers, but convincing happy C++ developers of this
            isn't simple.</p>

            <p>But more than that, Rust's fundamental model -
            <em>ownership and borrowing</em> - is effectively
            a <em>new programming paradigm</em> - it requires users to
            adapt to a <em>new way of thinking</em> about how they
            manage the resources in their code. Programmers who make
            that connection tend to find the Rust model significantly
            <em>clarifiies their own thinking</em> about code, but it
            does take <em>investment</em> on the programmers part, and an
            <em>openness</em> to new ideas.</p>

            <p>It's also possible that plain competition could win
            over Rust. In much the same way C, a "worse is better"
            solution, dominated the market for decades by working in
            all the right places, some other language may do what Rust
            does just good enough. Or a new language might do Rust
            better than Rust.</p>

          <h3>Challenges for Rust replacing C++</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>C++ language interop</li>
            <li>Build system integration</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We think Rust is an excellent C++ replacement
            today. Both languages have <em>similar costs and
            performance</em>, but Rust has the advantage of <em>memory
            safety and a clean slate</em>.</p>

            <p>The biggest challenge to Rust's adoption in the systems
            space is <em>interoperating</em> with the vast amounts of
            C++ code running the world today. Note that I say "C++"
            and not "C and C++". Interop with C is quite simple and
            Rust can masquerade as C all day. Interop with C++ on the
            other hand is very, very hard, and few languages do it
            successfully.</p>

            <p>Along those same lines, we've already encountered a
            number of challenges integrating Rust into <em>existing
            build systems</em>. Rust has it's own opinionated package
            manager called Cargo, and while it works very well,
            teaching it to integrate with all the various build
            systems used for C and C++ is an ongoing process. This is
            something we're hearing a lot from users right now, and
            working to address.</p>

        <section id="CHC">
          <h3>Challenges for Rust replacing C</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ABI stability &#x2000; <span>(upgradable dlls)</span></li>
            <li>Monomorphization &#x2000; <span>(binary bloat)</span></li>
            <li>Unstructured control flow &#x2000; <span>(setjmp / longjmp, goto)</span></li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Rust replacing C is in some ways a simpler story than
            replacing C++, and some ways more complex. <em>C is a much
            easier language to interop with than C++</em>, and because
            of that it tends to be used for the <em>lowest layers</em>
            of the stack, in <em>system libraries</em>
            and <em>operating system kernels</em>.</p>

            <p>The big thing that Rust needs to make inroads at that
            level is <em>ABI stability</em> - that is, the capacity to do
            seamless upgrades of dynamic libraries between point
            releases. Today Rust provides very strong <em>source
            stability</em>, but not <em>binary stability</em>.</p>

            <p>Another significant technical challenge for Rust in
            comparison to C is its approach to <em>generics</em>. Rust
            uses a technique called "monomorphisation", which simply
            means that each time the Rust compiler instantiates a
            generic function it emits a fresh, optimized, copy of the
            machine code. This creates fast code, but also results in
            large binary sizes that C programmers are unaccustomed
            to.</p>

            <p>C also provides some unique features that might not be
            used often, but occasionally are used to achieve
            performance, things like setjmp/longjmp, and computed
            goto. It's not clear whether Rust would adopt such
            features to gain parity.</p>

          <h3>Why Rust will succeed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Incredible tech</li>
            <li>Production focus</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So there definitely are some challenges, and it's going to be a long
            road for Rust, but they are surmountable. And we have a lot of reason
            to be hopeful.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the greatest reason is that
            Rust's <em>technical foundations</em> are very, very
            strong. The runtimeless ownership model is a powerful base
            to build the entire computing stack on top of. We are
            <em>thankful</em> every week that, through some miracle,
            all the years of design work we did somehow left us in a
            real <em>sweet spot in the design space</em>.</p>

            <p>And having this strong technical foundation gives us
            <em>freedom</em> to focus on getting Rust
            into <em>production</em> in more places. From the very
            beginning, Rust has been <em>designed for production</em>,
            to fulfill the needs of Firefox, a product used by 100
            million people. And now we are in a position where if we
            just keep knocking down obstacles to production
            deployment, Rust will see wider and wider use. Our
            published <em>roadmap for 2017</em> is almost entirely
            about clearing the way for production users.</p>

        <section id="SUC2">
          <h3>Why Rust will succeed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Flexible ecosystem design</li>
            <li>Expanded systems audience</li>
            <li>Strong culture</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Another major systemic advantage we have built into
            Rust is the design of its <em>library ecosystem</em>, and the
            <em>separation between the language and the
            libraries</em>. Rust is quite modular, with much of its
            capabilities being provided by libraries. <em>For example,
            Rust knows nothing about concurrency</em>, but its
            libraries leverage ownership and borrowing to provide very
            robust and foolproof concurrency abstractions.</p>

            <p>The Rust <em>standard library itself is quite small</em>,
            providing core data structures and operating system
            abstractions. Everything else is provided via Rust's
            package manager <em>Cargo and the library
            ecosystem</em>. This was a very intentional decision to
            ensure both a high quality core product, and to
            encourage <em>free and rapid experimentation</em> in the
            Rust community, and it has paid off well - we see great
            libraries coming out of the Rust community, and as they
            mature they will be adopted into the Rust cannon.</p>

            <p>The convenience, flexibility, and robustness of the Rust
            system is additionally going to vastly <em>expand the
            audience of systems programmers</em>.</p>

            <p><em>With Rust, systems programming is easy and
            accessible.</em></p>

            <p>This is one of the biggest <em>revelations</em> we've had
            in Rust's development - that <em>there are vast audiences
            that want to write low level code but don't want to write
            C and C++</em>. We see a lot of young programmers with
            backgrounds in Ruby and JavaScript getting into Rust, and
            creating their own high-performance systems software for
            the first time.</p>

            <p>And this points to Rust's greatest strength - it's
            <em>culture and community</em>.</p>

            <p><em>In Rust we are building a new systems
            programming culture, and it is going to be expansive and
            welcoming and accessible, and it is going to change the
            nature of systems programming for the better.</em></p>

            But that's just what <em>we're</em> doing to enable Rust
            <em>developers</em>. What's really going to happen over
            the next few years is that a lot of <em>world-class</em>
            software is going to be <em>written in Rust</em>. And that
            software is going to be <em>reliable, reusable, and

            memory-unsafe languages is not. These programs are going
